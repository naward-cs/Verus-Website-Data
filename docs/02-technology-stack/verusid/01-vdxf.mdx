:::
VDXF stands for ``Verus Data Exchange Format``. Within a VerusID is the `contentmap` and the `contentmultimap`.

### Contentmultimap
It's a read/write database that gets cleared every time the identity is updated. But all the historical updates live on in the blockchain.  Using the APIs in the daemon, you can easily see the overall content of the multimap. Also, all kinds of data can be stored in there, and the structure of the data is not so tightly limited as the original contentmap.


### Contentmap
More on this later.
